TODO

DONE
* Initial functionality
* Support quotes (will have to do some memory allocation insanity for this one)
* Custom macros for buffer types (will save a little bit of my sanity at the cost of macro fuckery)
* Check if anything else is missing (compare to csv-spec.org)
    * https://csv-spec.org/spec/0.9.0-draft.2.html
    * Seems okay!
* Document the functions

ABANDONED
* Custom delimiters (anything except \r, \n and ")
* Actually make the executable useful for command-line (get cell by coordinates, get line length, get cell by line number + column header name etc)
    * CLI argument parsing needs to be worked on as well :)))
* make install
* Refactor code to use errno-style error handling
